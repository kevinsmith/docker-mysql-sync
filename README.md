# klsmith/mysql-sync

A Docker utility that wraps MySQL command line tools to perform a one-way sync from one database to another.

Since the source database may be in another Docker container that is still in the process of coming up, this utility automatically waits on the source database to become accessible before continuing.

## Usage

There are several ways to run `klsmith/mysql-sync`.

Stand-alone:

```
docker run -e SRC_HOST=sourcehost.example.com \
    -e SRC_PORT=source_db_port \
    -e SRC_NAME=source_db_name \
    -e SRC_PASS=source_db_pass \
    -e SRC_USER=source_db_user \
    -e DEST_HOST=destinationhost.example.com \
    -e DEST_PORT=destination_db_port \
    -e DEST_NAME=destination_db_name \
    -e DEST_PASS=destination_db_pass \
    -e DEST_USER=destination_db_user \
    klsmith/mysql-sync
```

Docker Compose:

```
version: '2'

services:
  mysql-sync:
    image: 'klsmith/mysql-sync:latest'
    environment:
      - SRC_HOST=sourcehost.example.com
      - SRC_PORT=source_db_port
      - SRC_NAME=source_db_name
      - SRC_PASS=source_db_pass
      - SRC_USER=source_db_user
      - DEST_HOST=destinationhost.example.com
      - DEST_PORT=destination_db_port
      - DEST_NAME=destination_db_name
      - DEST_PASS=destination_db_pass
      - DEST_USER=destination_db_user

```

The important bits are the environment variables, **all of which are required**.

| Environment Variable | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| SRC_HOST | Source db hostname |
| SRC_PORT | Source db port |
| SRC_NAME | Source db name |
| SRC_PASS | Source db password |   
| SRC_USER | Source db username |
| DEST_HOST | Destination db hostname |
| DEST_PORT | Destination db port |
| DEST_NAME | Destination db name |
| DEST_PASS | Destination db password |   
| DEST_USER | Destination db username |

The container will exit with code 0 when the sync finishes.
